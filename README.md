I attempted and completed all three parts of the extra credit. My custome room is a boathouse, west of the lake, in which the player can find a crowbar to gain acess to the kitchen. 

The biggest challenge in this assignment was understanding what was meant in the original code, so that it could be properly ported into my version. I accomplished this by refering heavily to the instructions provided, as well as returning to an original copy of the code.
